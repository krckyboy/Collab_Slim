# Collab - slim version (_currently under development_)

## Description
The goal of the app is to connect people to work on projects. The biggest advantage of this web app is allowing developers to choose on which project they will work on. It’s different than other job listing apps because you don’t usually know what you’ll be working on, while that's not the case here. 

## User stories
John is a web developer working in a company. He has an assignment to find candidates for a new full-stack developer who will join the team. John heard about Collab web app and he decided to try his luck and find candidates there. John registers on Collab, fills up the info about his location, social media that he’s using. 

John creates a project which is an e-commerce website, filling up the name, description of the project, and within the description, he also enters what are the things that he needs help with, url so users can visit the website as it’s live, he adds two images of the website which are logo and the screenshot of the landing page. He takes the most of the text editor where he enters the description of the project, formatting it very nicely.

John adds skills that are required for the project and those are “node.js” and “react.js”. John adds tags for easier filtering and better visibility when other users search for a project: ‘ecommerce’. Since John is looking for candidates for a job position, and since you get salary when you work, he marks the project in that way, setting “paying” part to true. After creating the project, it can be seen on the project feed page and can be searched in the search bar.

This is the approximate info about the project that John created:
1. Name: J-Fashion
2. Description: E-commerce website made in Node.js and React.js. For the DB, PostgreSQL is used. Need help with refactoring all codebase to ES6. Looking for a full-stack developer from Houston, ideally, but remote work is also a possibility. 
3. Location: Houston
4. Remote: yes
5. Images: logo.png, landingpage.png
6. Skills: node, react.
7. Tags: ecommerce
8. Paying: yes

Another user, David, has joined the web app. He’s currently unemployed, but would like to get a web development job. He knows node pretty well and is currently working on a react course, so he’s getting better at it. David isn’t currently working on a project as he doesn’t have inspiration for one, so he wanted to check the web app, to see if he can find something he can work on, maybe he’ll get lucky and get a job or fill up his portfolio which will make it easier for him to get that job he’s looking for. David fills up his profile with skills and other info, making sure that when someone looks at his profile it will appear as a CV, so he can bump up his chances of getting accepted to work on a project. David also makes sure to enter his website link, so people can check out his portfolio. 

David searches for projects, entering skills that he has (node, react), setting the filter “paying” to true. He looks at the results, clicks on John’s project to see more info about it. David reads the project info and decides that he would like to give it a try. David decides to apply for joining the project, clicking on “apply” and then as the new page pops up, where he can enter text which John would see, he decides to share some info about his past experiences and how he thinks the project will benefit if John decides that David should join the team.

John receives a notification that he has a request for the project, taking a look into it, seeing it’s David. John reads the message in the request, checks David’s profile, checking his Github, Linkedin profile, reading his biography part on the profile, seeing his part work experience. John clicks on the website url that David entered, checking his portfolio. 

This is where the goal of the app is reached. It’s up to John whether he will contact David or not. Only John can see David’s contact info (email, for example), because he sent the request to join the project. 

John doesn’t get any new requests for two days. He decides to see which users have the required skills that he listed for the project. A list of 10 users appears. He browses through some of them, finding user called Jessica. John visits her profile, checking all the details, and decides to let Jessica know that he’s interested in her. John clicks on “let this user know you’re interested in their skills”. 

Jessica would get a notification about that event, where it’s stated that John is interested in her skills for project “J-Fashion”. Once again, the goal of the app is reached. It’s up to Jessica to decide whether she will apply for the project or not. John does not have the contact details of Jessica unless she decides to apply to the project.
